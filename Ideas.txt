Website that teaches Calculus 1 and Calculus 2 through questions presented on the screen and answers
Website would have streaks for doing work, would require you to sign in
Screen reader ( extra accesibility)
chatgpt wrapper called like mathsBot or something that you can ask questions
Could have 2 sections, a course you can follow and a random Q section, mabye exam section aswell
could aglorithimcly come up with answer, which would allow you to see how the answer could be worked out
we could select which question would show up, would make showing how answer is done allot easier
